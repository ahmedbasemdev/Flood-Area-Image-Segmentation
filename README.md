## Define the Problem:
In this project I am trying to build a Flood area segmentation model, which can accurately segment out the water region in a given picture of a flood hit area. Such models can be used for flood surveys, better decision-making and planning.
## Collect and process the data:
The dataset contains images of flood hit areas and corresponding mask images showing the water region, There are 290 images and self annoted masks. The mask images were created using Label Studio, an open source data labelling software
**Naviagate Dataset:**

 - Image: Folder containing all the flood images.
 - Mask: Folder containing all the mask images
 - metadata.csv: A csv file mapping the image name with its mask.
